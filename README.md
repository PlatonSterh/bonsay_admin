# Getting started

You can use docker-compose to easily start app.

First of all, install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you don't have it on your machine. Make sure you follow all prerequisites.

Now, you can execute this command:

```
# build containers and run application
docker-compose up
```
